# Captains log

## August 30th, 2022
I am starting  this log as a way of tracking my progress in the learning of Python.
My goal is to work on it every day, even a bit, and commit code daily.
The first exercises will be simple, but as the learning progresses I expect to be adding solutions to complex problems too.
I started the course on September 25th, and I plan to finish it by October 7th.

### Lesson 144 Exercise
Had to rethink twice the use of reverse() and extend() as they act upon the original object and return None. Other than that it was a good refresher of these four odd functions: map(), filter(), zip(), and return()
I realised that I made an error of judgement using reverse() as in real life the list may have not been "just" reversed but unsorted.
