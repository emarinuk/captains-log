# captains-log

### August 30th, 2022
I am starting  this log as a way of tracking my progress in the learning of Python.
My goal is to work on it every day, even a bit, and commit code daily.
The first exercises will be simple, but as the learning progresses I expect to be adding solutions to complex problems too.
